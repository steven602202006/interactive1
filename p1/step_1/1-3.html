    	<q><SPAN style="font-size: 50px">T</SPAN><h3>he web was not envisioned as a form of television when it was invented. But, like it or not, it is rapidly resembling TV: linear, passive, programmed and inward-looking.</h3></q>
<br>
<SPAN style="font-size: 50px">W</SPAN>hen I log on to Facebook, my personal television starts. All I need to do is to <br> scroll: New profile pictures by friends, short bits of opinion on current <br>affairs, links to new stories with short captions, advertising, and of course <br>self-playing videos. I occasionally click on like or share button, read peoples’ <br>comments or leave one, or open an article. But I remain inside Facebook, and it <br>continues to broadcast what I might like. This is not the web I knew when I went <br>to jail. This is not the future of the web. This future is television.

<SPAN style="font-size: 50px">S</SPAN>ometimes I think maybe I’m becoming too strict as I age. Maybe this is all a <br>natural evolution of a technology. But I can’t close my eyes to what’s happening: A <br>loss of intellectual power and diversity, and on the great potentials it could <br>have for our troubled time. In the past, the web was powerful and serious enough <br> to land me in jail. Today it feels like little more than entertainment. So <br>much that even Iran doesn’t take some — Instagram, for instance — serious enough to <br>block.

<SPAN style="font-size: 50px">I</SPAN> miss when people took time to be exposed to different opinions, and bothered to <br>read more than a paragraph or 140 characters. I miss the days when I could write <br> something on my own blog, publish on my own domain, without taking an equal <br>time to promote it on numerous social networks; when nobody cared about likes and <br> reshares.
